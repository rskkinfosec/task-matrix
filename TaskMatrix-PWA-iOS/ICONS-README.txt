📝 ICON PLACEHOLDER

You need to add your own app icons:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

OPTIONS:

Option 1: Use an online generator
- Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload any image
- Download generated icons

Option 2: Create manually
- Make square PNG images
- 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
- Name exactly as above

Option 3: Use a logo
- Your company logo
- App screenshot
- Any square image

Until you add real icons, the PWA will use browser defaults.
The app will still work, just won't have a custom icon on the home screen.
